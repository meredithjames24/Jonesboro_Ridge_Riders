        <p>The Jonesboro Ridge Rider Mountain Bike Team was established in 2020. Since our inception, we have been dedicated to providing middle school and high school athletes with the opportunity to experience the excitement and camaraderie of mountain biking.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>Our primary competition is in the Arkansas NICA League, where we participate in events that challenge our skills and bring us together as a team. Our pre-season begins in April, and we start regular practices in July, focusing on both personal growth and team success.</p>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>While we are a race team, our focus goes beyond race results. Our goal is constant improvement, building confidence, and fostering a love for mountain biking. We have a team of dedicated coaches who work tirelessly to ensure every athlete has the greatest experience possible.</p>

        <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
